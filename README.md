    Spacecraft List Page: Displays a list of all spacecraft with their basic information. Users can click on a spacecraft to view its details.

    Spacecraft Details Page: Displays detailed information about a selected spacecraft, including its name, type, capacity, and more. Users can also initiate actions like building or destroying a spacecraft from here.

    Planet Viewer Page: Shows a visualization of planets and spacecraft on them. Users can select a planet and view the spacecraft on it. They can also send spacecraft between planets.

    Build Spacecraft Page: Allows users to build a new spacecraft by providing necessary information like name, type, and capacity.
